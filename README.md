# Tasks
In src you will find LeetCode Package and CodeGym package.
Name of each file is problem name, so it is easy to find them on LeetCode / CodeGym. Before solution, there is full problem description.
CodeGym contains MediumLevel of Tasks and HardLevel. Please note, that there are only small part of all CodeGym tasks, as most of them are too easy and will not be interesting.
In LeetCode there are 3 packages and several stand-alone files. Packages contains only LeetCode problems(tasks). 
Seperate files are problems I found on different sources, but they are similar to LeetCode problems.
Also, i would kindly ask to give feedback about my code, if it is possible
