# LeetCodeTasks
There are 3 packages and several stand-alone files. Packages contains only LeetCode problems(tasks). 
Name of each file is problem name, so it is easy to find them on LeetCode. Before solution, there is full problem description.
Several files is problems i found on different sources, but they are similar to LeetCode problems.
Also, i would kindly ask to give feedback about my code, if it is possible
